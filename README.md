# Football (soccer) Betting AI Model

This is a **machine learning** project that builds a **reinforcement learning–based** football (soccer) betting system.
It scrapes match data, learns predictive representations using **deep learning**, and allocates bets using **reinforcement learning** and **portfolio optimization**.

## Features
- **Scrape and preprocess** football match data from **FBRef** (respecting their robots.txt).
- Train a predictive match outcome model using **PyTorch**. (work in progress)
- Use **reinforcement learning** to simulate and optimize betting strategies. (work in progress)
- Manage risk and bankroll allocation intelligently. (work in progress)
